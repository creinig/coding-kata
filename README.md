## My Philosophy for solving Kata

My kata solutions you can find here are typically more verbose and potentially not as efficient as most others.

This is because I don't treat them as isolated exercises, but as small parts of a potentially large production 
codebase that will hopefully live and evolve for a long time and will be maintained by an entire team of 
developers.

In other words, my focus is not on especially clever solutions, but on code that is easy to understand, easy to 
maintain and easy to extend / modify.

## Multiple Languages

I keep kata implementations for multiple languages in this repository, mostly because they often implement the same kata.
